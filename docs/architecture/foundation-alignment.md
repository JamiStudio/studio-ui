# Foundation Alignment

Status: Active boundary
Owner: Jami.Studio
Last updated: 2026-06-09

## Purpose

Studio UI and Jami Harness are sibling foundation projects. They stay
separate so each can publish, version, and integrate independently, but they share a
deliberate contract surface under the `@jami-studio/*` family.

## Sibling Repositories

- `studio-ui`: source at `C:\Users\james\dev\orgs\oss\registry\studio-ui`.
- `jami-harness`: source at `C:\Users\james\dev\orgs\oss\registry\jami-harness`.

Path-lock evidence checked on 2026-06-09:

- `studio-ui` is a Git worktree at `C:\Users\james\dev\orgs\oss\registry\studio-ui`
  with `origin` set to `https://github.com/JamiStudio/studio-ui.git`.
- `jami-harness` is a Git worktree at `C:\Users\james\dev\orgs\oss\registry\jami-harness`
  with `origin` set to `https://github.com/JamiStudio/jami-harness.git`.
- Active Studio UI boundary docs and roadmaps use these registry-root sibling paths.

The repositories should remain separate until a later decision record proves that one
workspace would reduce real release or integration friction. Planning convenience is not
enough reason to merge them.

## Responsibility Split

Studio UI owns:

- Tokens, factory themes, and generated design-system outputs.
- Radix-first shadcn primitives, components, blocks, pages, app shells, and suites.
- shadcn-compatible registry items and install-time package metadata.
- Resident runtime renderer vocabulary, payload validation, and UI fallback behavior.
- Always-live workbench overlay, theme/preset save flows, package registration, and
  registry export.
- CLI install/config flows for UI items, themes, pages, apps, and suites.

Jami Harness owns:

- Agent run, task, session, plan, handoff, retry, cancellation, and checkpoint contracts.
- Tool, MCP, OpenAPI, function-tool, shell/browser/code, and provider adapter execution.
- Policy, approval, actor, scope, identity, secret-reference, and audit decisions.
- Memory, citation, context, evidence, trace, metric, and artifact lifecycle.
- Agent-facing CLI, SDK, run inspection, docs generation, and release evidence flows.

## Shared Contracts

The shared seam is typed data, not arbitrary code:

- Harness emits structured artifact, action, state, and UI payload references.
- Studio UI validates and renders those payloads with resident allowlisted components.
- Harness action refs stay policy-gated and auditable.
- Studio UI components expose declared action slots and never execute model-provided code.
- Theme, preset, registry item, and suite metadata can be referenced by harness artifacts
  but remain authored and distributed by Studio UI.

Current root source-lock evidence lives at
`C:\Users\james\dev\orgs\oss\registry\docs\operations\source-lock-evidence.md`.
That root record is sufficient for planning alignment, but implementation work in this repo
still needs repo-local source-lock records and failing checks before adopting shadcn,
Tailwind, DTCG, Agent-Native reference material, AG-UI payload semantics, package publishing,
static registry hosting, renderer safety guidance, or release attestation tooling.

Initial shared contract families:

- `uiPayload`: component name, props, children, action refs, vocabulary generation, and
  fallback metadata.
- `artifactView`: artifact id, kind, provenance, promoted state, available renderers, and
  source evidence references.
- `actionRef`: stable id, label, risk, policy scope, confirmation mode, and harness route.
- `themeRef`: theme id, token version, source registry item, factory/custom status, and
  restore target.
- `suiteRef`: suite lane, installed item graph, app shell id, route map, and optional
  harness capabilities.

Studio UI's first machine-readable mirror for these families lives under
`packages/renderer/fixtures/compatibility/` and is checked by `pnpm contracts:check`.
The fixture set covers `uiPayload`, `artifactView`, denied `actionRef`, `themeRef`,
`suiteRef`, unsupported components, invalid payloads, and renderer error states.
`docs/architecture/compatibility-contract.md` records the expected harness handshake.

## Integration Direction

The first integration should be contract-first:

1. Studio UI defines renderer payload schema and component vocabulary.
2. Harness defines artifact/action/policy references that can point at UI payloads.
3. Both repos add machine-readable compatibility fixtures for shared payloads, action
   responses, artifact views, theme refs, suite refs, unsupported components, denied
   actions, invalid payloads, and renderer error states.
4. Suite packs consume harness capabilities through adapters, not direct runtime imports.
5. The showcase app can import both packages through normal package boundaries once each
   side has stable exports.

## Non-Goals

- Do not merge the repos only because planning happens in parallel.
- Do not let the harness own UI primitives, token decisions, or registry packaging.
- Do not let the UI registry own policy execution, tool invocation, memory writes, or
  agent runtime state.
- Do not render arbitrary model-provided React, HTML, scripts, or package imports.
- Do not accept shared harness/UI contracts as prose-only alignment; every active seam
  needs schemas or fixtures and failing-closed negative cases.
- Do not duplicate full roadmaps across repos; link them and keep project-specific
  execution in the owning repo.
